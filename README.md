# kyliestewart.tech

[This website](https://kyliestewart.tech) serves as my professional landing page,
as well as my technical blog, where I post about the various programming things
I've learned or am actively learning.

Now built with âœ¨[nextjs](https://nextjs.org)!

## Development

### Adding a New Blog Post

All blog posts live in the `content/` directory.
Every new post requires a `title`, YYYY-MM-DD formatted `date`, and category `string` to properly compile.

### Adding a New Talk

Talks are sourced from [my `all-talks` repo](https://github.com/kale-stew/all-talks) here on Github.

## Deployment

Vercel's deployment pipeline takes care of publication on merge to `main`.
